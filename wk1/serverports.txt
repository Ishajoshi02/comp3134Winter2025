2. Registered Ports: 1024–49151 (used for specific applications and services).
3. Dynamic/Private Ports: 49152–65535 (used for temporary connections, also called ephemeral ports).

3. How many bits does the number above represent?
Ans:- A server port number is represented by 16 bits (2 bytes), which allows for 65,536 unique port numbers (0 to 65535).
